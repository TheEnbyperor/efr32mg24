description: >
  In Bluetooth LE Power Control feature, the controller adjusts a connected peer
  deviceâ€™s transmit power level based on the received signal level.

  When this feature is used by the application, the functionality is enabled and
  will be automatically effective if the peer device supports this feature.

  TX power changes on the local and peer device are reported to the application.
  The "connection" class provides APIs to read the latest TX power of the local or
  remote device. It also provides APIs to enable or disable TX power reporting.

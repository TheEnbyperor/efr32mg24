# SoC - CS Initiator

The Bluetooth SoC-CS initiator is a project that can be used to test the Channel Sounding (CS) feature. In the provided CS setup, the application creates a connection to a reflector (Running on the host or SoC), measures the phase (PBR) or timing (RTT) and estimates the distance.

## Usage
Build and flash the sample application.
After startup it will scan for a device running the "CS RFLCT"" sample application. When found, the initiator will create a connection between them and will start the distance measurement process. The initiator will calculate the distance, display them on the LCD and also send them via UART.

## Known issues and limitations

* Only one initiator instance created

## Troubleshooting

This sample application does need a bootloader (AppLoader OTA DFU).
